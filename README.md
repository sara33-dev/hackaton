# Hackathon Wild Code School


## Context

Year 2021. Wild Code School Bordeaux challenged the PHP promo on a 1-day hackathon. 
The (weird) theme : The two robots Ingenuity and Perseverance just landed on Mars. After some times, they start to get bored and are looking for new ways to waste their times.
Students must design some nice attractions to keep them motivated.

## Realization
What do you miss the most when you're left alone ? A soul mate for sure ! 
Thus we developed an old school web app where the user can put himself in the shoes of Perseverance and start to move on a 2D map of Mars looking for his beloved one. On his path, he will meet weird nice creatures who will give him some cues on the exact location of his love one. But he has to find it quickly as the NASA start to understand something is going wrong and threaten to shut him down.
